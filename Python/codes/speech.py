Anyways, after an hour on the highway, I finally got into our town and got onto the country road that leads to his house. I was in the home stretch.

Suddenly, his car pulls out right in front of me from this random-ass road and starts speeding away. I could hear his music through my rolled-up windows. If I had just gone a little faster on the country road (I was going the speed limit), I would have beat himâ€¦""")
